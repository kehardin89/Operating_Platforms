**- Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**

The "Gaming Room" was the client. This company is mainly a mobile app game creator for Android, and they wanted to expand their game platforms to Mac, Windows, Linux, and IOS.

**- What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**

I wrote a comprehensive recommendation section outlining critical areas for the clients, including the host operating systems, memory and storage management, solutions on host servers, the API framework, security, and the benefits of leveraging serverless architecture to launch the product.

**- What about working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**

  The process that helped the most with the design document while developing the code would have to be the UML class diagram, which represented the understanding of the structure and the relations between entities representing the app components. 

**- What would you pick if you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise? How would you improve it?**

If I could revise one document, it would be the evaluation section comparing the contrasting popular OSs and evaluating each OS in more depth. Since the OS was favored as the most popular, I felt that I could have researched more into this topic and given a more unbiased option. 

**- How did you interpret and implement the user's needs into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user's needs when designing?**

I could interpret the user's needs and implement them into my software design based on two characteristics: speed and usability. As the user looks for this app, their opinion of this base will be how familiar and likable this game is to them and whether it responds immediately and has almost no loading time.
